classify SMILES entries into functional group and generate structure images
Download CID-SMILES.gz from ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubchem/Compound/Extras/
run get_functional_groups.py. This file will take CID-SMILES as input and generate fg_smiles.csv as output
run draw_mol_struct.py. This file will take fg_smiles.csv as input and generate molecular images classified into fuctional groups
